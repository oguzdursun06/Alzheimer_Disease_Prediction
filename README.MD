In this project, we are trying to accurately diagnose the various stages of Alzheimer's Disease, which is a disease that occurs especially in advanced ages and decreases the quality of life, by using different classification methods through magnetic resonance images.  To accomplish this goal we used methods such as KNN, SVM, Random Forest, DenseNet and VGG16. After evaluating the results of those methods, DenseNet has the most accurate result with 86.91% accuracy.

Alzheimer's is a common type of dementia, a progressive neurological disease that causes brain cells to be destroyed.  In this disease which causes decrease in thought, memory and behavioral functions, symptoms reveal themselves as the age of the patient increases.
Alzheimer's is a disease with no definitive treatment, but with early diagnosis, the progression of the disease and the decline in the patient's quality of life can be slowed down. Early symptoms of Alzheimer's may not be taken seriously and might be associated with old age.  With this project pre-diagnosis of any patient with suspicion of Alzheimer can be done easily and quickly.


Our dataset consists of brain MRIs of patients with suspicion on Alzheimer’s Disease. Those MRIs are classified for train and test sets.  There are four stages of Alzheimer’s Disease in our dataset those are:
*	Moderate Demented
*	Mild Demented
*	Very Mild Demented
*	None Demented
